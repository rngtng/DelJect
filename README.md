# DelJect

An AppleScript to delete and eject any external Cards/USB Stick

A friend asked for this little script:
His problem was, that his photography camera couldn't deal with apple's hidden files like `.DS_STORE` etc. To workaorund that, he had to delete those files each time before ejecting. DelJect automates this manual process. Voila!


## Download
Get latest version here: [DelJect.app](https://github.com/downloads/rngtng/DelJect/deleject.app)


## Usage

Just run the binary, select the device (USB stick), confirm delete and unplug the stick. Done!

As litte gotcha, DelJect will remeber the device - so next time, just confirm & go.


## Disclamer
Thanks to [Niels](http://leuchtstoffk.de/) for the idea and thanks [Icon-Land](http://www.veryicon.com/icons/media/play-stop-pause/eject-normal-red.html) for Icon.
